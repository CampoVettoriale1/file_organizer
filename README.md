# downloads_cleaner

Very much a work in progress.

A barebones (right now) script that looks through your downloads folder and copies the files to respective subfolders based on the file type.

Parts of the code for this were borrowed from github.com/kallehallden, but I feel like I've atleast understood what's going on and made enough changes for this to deserve it's own repo.

Can think of a ton of issues to fix and features that I could still implement in this, like conditionally deleting files from Downloads iff they've been copied successfully.

Will keep updating as I work on this day by day.
